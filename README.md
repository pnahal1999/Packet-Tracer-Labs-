# Packet Tracer Labs

My collection of Cisco Packet Tracer labs to practice real-world configurations and troubleshooting that junior network engineers and desktop support analysts face every day.

## Why These Labs?
- Aligns directly with CCNA 200-301 and common job requirements
- Shows VLAN segmentation, routing protocols, end-host connectivity, and step-by-step troubleshooting
